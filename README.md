### The Assignment

A scientist is trying to understand how ducks are being fed in parks around the world. She wants to collect the following information:

- What time the ducks are fed
- What food the ducks are fed
- Where the ducks are fed
- How many ducks are fed
- What kind of food the ducks are fed
- How much food the ducks are fed
- Nice to have: the ability for a little old lady who feeds the ducks every day in the same way to set a repeating schedule so she doesnâ€™t have to use the application every day

The scientist would like to crowdsource this information by creating a web application where people can submit these data points. The scientist would like to be able to do reporting on the data for her PhD thesis.

### Technology

You may use any language or framework you choose. We prefer that you install the final product on AWS (or another freely available cloud hosting solution such as Heroku).

### Deliverables

- A link to the working application
- Access to your Git repository (please commit regularly - we find your commit history an interesting indicator as to how you like to work).
- A short written document outlining:
  - Your approach to the problem
  - Technologies chosen (and why)
  - A high-level component diagram
  - A database model diagram
  - Roughly how many hours you spent
